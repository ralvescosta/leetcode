## About

This repository contains my solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems, ranging from easy to hard. Each solution is crafted to be efficient and is accompanied by comments to enhance understanding. The primary goal is to improve problem-solving skills and provide a resource for others preparing for coding interviews.

## Languages Used

- Go
- Rust
- SQL

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, with each language's directory containing subdirectories for different problem categories or individual problems:

```
leetcode/ 
  ├── golang/ │ 
              ├── problem1/ │
              ├── problem2/ │ 
              └── ... 
  ├── rust/ │
            ├── problem1/ │
            ├── problem2/ │ 
            └── ... 
  └── sql/ │
           ├── problem1/ 
           ├── problem2/ 
           └── ...
```


Each problem directory includes:

- A detailed solution file (`main.go`, `main.rs`, `solution.sql`, etc.).
- A `README.md` file describing the problem statement, the approach taken, and any nuances of the solution.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ralvescosta/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired language directory**:

   ```bash
    cd golang  # For Go solutions
   ```

   ```bash
    cd rust    # For Rust solutions
   ```

   ```bash
    cd sql     # For SQL solutions
   ```

3. **Review the solutions**:

Each problem directory contains the solution file and a README.md with detailed explanations.
